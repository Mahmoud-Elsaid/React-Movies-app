# React Movies App

A simple movie listing app built with React and Vite.

## Project Setup

This project uses Vite for fast development and React for building the user interface. 

### Requirements

- Node.js (v16.0 or higher)
- npm (v7.0 or higher)
- Java Runtime Environment (for backend)

### Frontend Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Mahmoud-Elsaid/React-Movies-app.git
   cd React-Movies-app
   ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The app will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

### Backend (JAR file)

To run the backend server, follow these steps:

1. Download and extract the backend JAR file (e.g., `backend.jar`).

2. Ensure you have a Java Runtime Environment installed.

3. Use the provided `.bat` file to start the backend server:

   - On Windows, double-click `run-backend.bat` to launch the backend.

   This will start your backend server, which the frontend will communicate with.

### How to Use

Once the backend is running, you can browse movies on the frontend, which will pull movie data from the backend.

### Additional Information

- This project does not have additional configurations for deployment.
- Future features may include user authentication, ratings, or movie details.
